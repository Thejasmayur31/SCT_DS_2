This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset. The objective was to understand content trends on Netflix by analyzing features like type (Movie/TV Show), release year, genres, duration, and country of origin. The project includes handling missing values, filtering inconsistencies, and creating insightful visualizations using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This task was completed as part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology, showcasing my skills in data preprocessing, analysis, and storytelling with real-world data.
